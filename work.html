                    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/om8AygYdrto" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

                        This IT professional is an information system technician, he said he was able to do everything he can. He works at home instead of in the office. Everyday, he spends his time ticketing the system – keeping tracks on what needs to be done, what is of high priority and what is not. Besides from that, he also does lots of computer imaging, answers the phone and creates user account, which is often email accounts, to manage users through that.
                        In one day, he spends most of his time answering the phone and ticketing the ticket. He talks and interacts with clients, and he sometimes meets other IT professionals, too. The most challenging task at his work is that he has to face different experience in IT day-to-day, so everyday is absolutely different.
                        
                    </p>
                    <h4> Second video</h4>
                    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cNSqKMOyayk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                    <p>
                      
                    The second video, the man is an IT professional working in India. His life revolves around coding. The video can be a bit of boring. First, he started his life at 5:00 in the morning by taking exercises. Then, he went to work and finally went home in the afternoon. He is living in a loop.
  

                    </p>
                    <h4>Third video</h4>
                    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e_TxH59MclA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                    <p>
                        The third video, the IT professional is working for a Japanese network entertainment company – Bandai Namco Studios. First thing in the morning, after going to work, he often checks his email and the company’s internal social network to keep up with the newest. Then, he starts working and coding for the whole day. In the noon, he has a scrum meeting – which takes place 30 minutes everyday. And in this meeting, they review what they have programmed in the previous day and what needs to be done, they also share and discuss problems that might come up in the future. Then, they write their reviews about the matters. They often use software to manage the tasks and show it on the screen in the meeting. In this company, they can play games and take a nap whenever they are tired. He usually interacts and shares not only with others IT professionals in a team but also with his colleagues in different departments. He spends most of his day coding. The challenge of his work is perhaps related with the project he is working on and problems that might occur to that project in the future.


                    </p>
                    <h4>Fourth video</h4>
                    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rTxo-KZ-JbY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                    <p>
                        In the fourth video, the IT professional wakes up early in the morning and takes exercise. After that, she go to work, and the first thing she does is to check her emails. Then, she starts coding and having meetings through phone with clients, her coworkers or with businesses. She sometimes exchanges information with her colleagues – the IT professionals. Her challenge at work is that she has to keep her mind fresh to be productive in the meeting all day long. 
                    </p>
                    <h4>Fifth video</h4>
                    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iWPeVxr5gsI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                    <p>
                      There are lots of IT professionals.  

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In this video, these IT professionals do:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        - Respond to bug requests, enhancements data changes  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        - Deploy software to judicial branch ( software application updates, Microsoft office,.. )
                    </p>
                    <p>- Provide customer service to the employees of the judicial branch by providing technical support with computer hardware or software</p>
                    <p>Their passion with IT:</p>
                    <p>- Solving problems</p>
                    <p>- Talking and helping people with their problems</p>
                    <p>Their advice: master language of the field you want to focus on</p>
                    <p>Challenge they have: always up to date with the newest technology, problems that are hard to solve</p>
                    <h4> Sixth video</h4>
                    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WWggmC8kYZc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                    <p>
                        After getting to work, like other IT professionals, he checks his mail. Then, he has a meet with his interns. The next step to do at work is coding and solving troubles with his friends. At the noon, he makes some design and then goes home. For the most of his day, he spends his time coding and solving the problems. And he also talks with his coworkers at work.


                    </p>
                    <h4> In conclusion...</h4>
                    <p>
                        After watching a day of the professionals above, the important things that I have learnt are that you have to take exercises and have enough meals in the day to keep your mind clear and creative at work. Also, always remember to check your mails to make sure that you are keeping up with the newest. Moreover,  you should study and practice hard until you master the language in the field you focus on. This is an important step in your learning progress which can affect your future quite a lot. If you have enough knowledge, it will be easier for you to solve problems and deal with the constant development of Technologies.
